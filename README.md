# _SOBRA SPHERE_ App Design

Design made with Figma for an app that works similarly to ToGoodToGo but for academic establishments.The app is a bridge between U.Porto's eateries and its community, transforming surplus into savings and pioneering a sustainable, zero-waste dining culture on campus.

## Features

- Search for restaurants
- Create food bag sales - only available to establishment staff accounts
